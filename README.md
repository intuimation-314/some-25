This project dives into the elegant symmetry of vector sums in 2D, 3D and even in nD. Starting with a circle and Euler's formula, we transition into spheres and uncover why equally spaced vectors — even in higher dimensions — cancel out. Includes visual proofs, algebraic reasoning, and Python simulations.

# 🌀 Vector Symmetry

## 📽️ A SoME 2025 Project  
This project explores a beautiful mathematical phenomenon:  
**Symmetric unit vectors placed evenly around a circle or a sphere or a hypersphere always sum to zero.**

We start with a 2D case using Euler’s formula and geometric intuition. Then, we extend the idea to 3D using spherical coordinates and group theory.  

In both cases, we provide **visual, algebraic, and computational verification**.
